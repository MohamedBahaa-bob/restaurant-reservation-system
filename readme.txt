Anavrin Reservation System

This system is designed to be used by the Anavrin’s clients and employees. Once the program 
runs the login window appears where the user is prompted to sign up as a new user or select 
his role (manager, waiter, cooker, client) enter his username and password, validation 
messages are set to guide the user if false data is entered.
Client:
As a client logs in, a window with a welcome message is visible which allows the user to choose 
the number of desired seats and whether he wants to sit in the smoking or non-smoking area. If 
there is a table available that meets his specifications he’s allowed to access the next screen 
where he makes his order. Combo boxes are available which informs the customer of today’s 
plates and prices accompanied by text field where he enters the desired number of each plate, 
the total cost is also visible as the user chooses his plates. Furthermore, he’s permitted to enter 
special requests which are only seen by Anavrin’s chef.

Waiter:

As a waiter logs in, a window with a motivational message is visible which contains a table that 
includes today’s customers, their reserved table and its details.

Cooker:

As a cooker logs in, a window with an encouraging message is visible. The window contains 
today’s ordered plates accompanied by the table number so that the orders are always ready 
by time. Also, in case the customer has any special requests they’re included along with the 
customer table number.

Manager:

As the manager logs in, a window with an inspirational message is visible. The manager is 
permitted to access the waiters and cookers screen for more efficient supervision. There is also 
a daily review which only the manager is authorized to access, it includes today’s customers, 
table, receipt and the day total earnings so far. Once the manager’s done he is able to log out, 
return to the previous window or access the statistics window. Statistics window opens with a 
bar chart of today best plates sorted by the number of times they were ordered and the ability 
to sort it by earnings.
